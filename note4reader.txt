hey this is Banvi Menghani!
this is my 2nd git repo so, excited!:)
this one's about another technology currently in the 
limelight\\\ ya! you guessed it right FACIAL RECOGNITION
i made it for one of the hackathon in my college and yay! 
we were 1st runnerups then!

this is bascially divided into 3 parts :python,openCV and tkinter
the program bascially 
1. stores the facial information of a new user with its
 name and number and about 60 images
2. next it recognizes when the same face appears again in the webcam
3. and marks the atendence in a csv file.
